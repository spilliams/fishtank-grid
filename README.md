What's better than just targeting 720p and 1080i/p devices using ugly media queries? Degradable, flexible grids that minimize page overflow. This simple implementation displays many tiles on a screen, and chooses a specific "grade" to display the tile at. The higher grades are bigger, and presumably contain more content. It only requires jQuery 1.1.4+ (untested below 1.7.1)
